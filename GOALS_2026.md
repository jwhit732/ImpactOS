## Cross-Cutting Themes

**Integration**: All goals support each other. Health enables career performance. Relationships provide meaning. Growth enhances all areas.

**Flexibility**: This is a living document. Review and adjust quarterly based on what's working and what matters most.

**Focus**: Not everything at once. Choose 1-2 priorities per quarter to prevent overwhelm.

**Celebration**: Acknowledge progress, not just achievement. The journey matters more than the destination.
